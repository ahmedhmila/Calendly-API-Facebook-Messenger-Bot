## Introduction

The Calendly-API-Facebook-Messenger-Bot is a Python script that leverages the Calendly API to fetch scheduled events and send automated messages to a specified Facebook Messenger group chat.

## Features

- **Integration with Calendly:** Fetches scheduled events and their details from the Calendly API.
- **Automated Messaging:** Sends messages with event information to a Facebook Messenger group chat.
- **Customizable Interval:** Define how often the script runs to send updates to the group chat.
- **User-Friendly:** Uses Selenium to log in to Facebook and send messages, making it easy to set up and use.
